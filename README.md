docker-registry
===
A CLI wrapper for the docker v2 API written in Rust. 

  

## About
This package provides a command line interface for the Docker v2 API. Documentation on the V2 API can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/).

## Building

<i>docker-registry</i> is built with cargo, so simply run 
```
cargo build --release
```

in the project's root directory. 



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The binary will be placed in `<project root>/target/release/docker-registry`. Specifiy `--help` to get a full
list of commands/options.

The supported commands are:
- `LIST` - List all images hosted in the repository
- `TAGS` - List all tags associated to an image
- `MANIFEST` - Retrieve the full manifest for an image
- `DIGEST` - Receive the sha digest of an image
- `DELETE` - Delete an image

Example usage for deleting an image:
```
 docker-reg delete git.taylorcressy.com -u "<username>" -p "<password>" -i taylorcressy/hello-world -t latest
```

## Authentication

In order to authenticate against the registry, you can specify your username and password as cli args. `-u` and `-p` respectively. If only specifying `-u` a password prompt will
appear. Alternatively, you can specify your credentials in a configuration file. This can either be explicitly referenced by passing a path to `--conf` or utilizing the default path
`${HOME}/.docker-registry/config`.

Example file:
```
[auth]
username=<your username>
password=<your password>
```
